You work in an orbital station, however suddenly hostile aliens attack, and now the only way you can survive is by reaching the evacuation shuttle! Your laser tool can merge platforms together, use it to create a pathway!

Controls:
AD - move
Space - Jump (you can double jump just hit space twice)
Left Click - Hold to drag platforms and release them on nearby platforms to merge them together.

Tips:

In order to make a platform mid air, drag a platform and attach it to another while they are in the air.

  
We hope you will enjoy this game. Good luck and have fun!
